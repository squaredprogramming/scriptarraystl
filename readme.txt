Squared'D Programming AngelScript Wrapper for STL-Style Array
2014-01-04

This software was written to allow C++ programs that use AngelScript to be able to more easily share arrays between AngelScript and C++ by providing an array type that behaves like std::vector in C++ and like normal script arrays in AngelScript.

To use the sample provided, the project directories should work if you copy the "scriptarraystl" folder to the AngelScript SDK add_on folder. Only ScriptArraySTL.h needs to be included as well as the CScriptArray add-on to use this.
